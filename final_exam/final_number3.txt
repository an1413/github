The grass is always greener.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Don't count the chickens before they hatch.
Rome was not built in a day. 
No pain, no gain.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
Blood is thicker than water. 
The more, the better.
A friend in need is a friend indeed. 
Haste makes waste. 
Manners maketh man.
A golden key opens every door.
Walls have ears. 
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. 
A good medicine tastes bitter. 
Practice makes perfect.
A picture is worth a thousand words. 
Better late than never.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
Easy come, easy go. 
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Time is money.
A rolling stone gathers no moss. 
No news is good news. 
Even a worm will turn.
Innocence is bliss.
Well begun is half done.
Actions speak louder than words.
